 I am a Controls and Automation Engineer with a strong background in development and robotic process automation (RPA). Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience in Python, C++, AWS, and specialized automation tools such as UiPath and Automation Anywhere.

My background includes building and optimizing complex workflows, where I apply my RPA expertise to improve operational efficiency and reduce manual errors. I have proven experience in analyzing business processes and applying scalable and efficient solutions to automation challenges.
